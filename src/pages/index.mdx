	## Computers 

	I totally love programming, but hold on a sec, gaming has been my jam since way back when. I remember my earliest computer memories involved scavenging games from a bunch of friends.
	
	Then the internet became a thing, and I got into online gaming. It sparked all sorts of ideas for me to mess around with game servers - I mean, I once managed to reset lives to unlimited in a small first-person shooter game, and they ended up banning me! But hey, it really got me interested in computers.
	
	I kicked off my developer journey with web development, mostly diving into Node.js, MongoDB, and basic React. Then, out of the blue, I started messing with assembly language, thanks to some coursework. After that, I spent a good couple of years dabbling in C and C++ stuff.

	These days, I'm all about Big Data and Data Warehousing. You can probably guess that I spend most of my time working on Databricks using Python and PySpark. Lately, I've gotten intrigued by operating systems and started chipping in on FreeBSD. But you know what? I'm itching to implement and learn RTOS from scratch - just for kicks! ðŸ˜„ Oh, and on top of all that, I'm also interested in diving into AI/ML. Seeing all this data just makes me want to do something cool with it!
	
	## Minetest
	Ahh, it's been a while since I've played on any of my servers. Man, I miss that. One of the best things COVID brought was the ability to attend classes in the background. I loved playing Minetest. Oh wait, I forgot to tell you what Minetest is! It's hard to keep my composure, you know? :P

	Minetest is an open-source voxel-based game. Well, what normal people call a Minecraft Clone, but it's actually more than that. It's written in C++ and exposes a Lua-based modding API. That's where all my Lua knowledge comes from.

	But from a learning perspective, I've learned a lot of stuff, like bare-metal server hosting, securing the server from threats (believe me, bot-net attacks are very common), to writing complex Lua mods. It's been a learning journey that never ended for me.

	## Music
	If you knew me personally, you could easily say I like music. In my early days, I used to listen to VH1 all night while studying :), don't ask me why. But eventually, I picked up a taste for pop music.
	
	Eventually, I grew up and moved to 70s, 80s, and 90s rock music, mostly mainstream artists like Beatles, Guns n' Roses, and The Eagles. Later, my taste changed to blues and spiritual slow rock. Then I found the "Tea for the Tillerman" album, such a masterpiece by Cat Stevens.

	I picked up the guitar in 2022 and still practice regularly, which kinda introduced me to more artists like Hozier, The Lumineers, and Mt. Joy. My favorite albums so far:
		- [Tea for the Tillerman] by Cat Stevens
		- [Hozier], [Wasteland Baby!], [Unreal Unearth] by Hozier
		- [Dark Side of the Moon] by Pink Floyd
		- [Hybrid Theory], [Meteora] by Linkin Park

	## Books

	I've always been a book person when it comes to learning new things, rather than following some random YouTube video. Although most of the books I've read in recent years have been technical, these days I'm trying out new genres like [Divine Comedy] by Dante.	

	Some of the books that I have enjoyed reading and can recommended to everyone.
		
	Technical Books
		- Pragmatic Programmer
		
	Non Technical Books
		- Divine Comedy (Dante): An excellent book if you love poetry. Its poetic fiction is top-notch, written/translated by Sisson.
		- Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (Steven Levy): A truly inspiring book. P.S.: It defines what hacker means; definitely not the person who hacks your computers! ðŸ˜œ


	## Projects
	
	Now that I have joined the Industry, there is not much time to devote to personal projects, yet I try to pick up something new every now and then.
	Here is the list of useful stuff I have created in past, some are still maintained while others more or less inactive.

	- **[BootBaker](https://github.com/mightyjoe781/bootbaker):** A more detailed summary is available [FreeBSD Wiki Page](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/CITestHarnessForBootloader). 
	- **[notes.minetest.in](https://notes.minetest.in/):** Comprehensive book summaries and notes on a wide range of useful topics.
