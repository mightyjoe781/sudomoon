	## Computers

	## Minetest
	Ahh, it's been a while since I've played on any of my servers. Man, I miss that. One of the best things COVID brought was the ability to attend classes in the background. I loved playing Minetest. Oh wait, I forgot to tell you what Minetest is! It's hard to keep my composure, you know? :P

	Minetest is an open-source voxel-based game. Well, what normal people call a Minecraft Clone, but it's actually more than that. It's written in C++ and exposes a Lua-based modding API. That's where all my Lua knowledge comes from.

	But from a learning perspective, I've learned a lot of stuff, like bare-metal server hosting, securing the server from threats (believe me, bot-net attacks are very common), to writing complex Lua mods. It's been a learning journey that never ended for me.

	## Music

	## Books
	I've always been a book person when it comes to learning new things, rather than following some random YouTube video. Although most of the books I've read in recent years have been technical, these days I'm trying out new genres like [Divine Comedy] by Dante.	
	Some of the books that I have enjoyed reading and can recommended to everyone.
		
	Technical Books
		- Pragmatic Programmer
		
	Non Technical Books
		- Divine Comedy (Dante): An excellent book if you love poetry. Its poetic fiction is top-notch, written/translated by Sisson.
		- Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (Steven Levy): A truly inspiring book. P.S.: It defines what hacker means; definitely not the person who hacks your computers! ðŸ˜œ


	## Projects
	
	Now that I have joined the Industry, there is not much time to devote to personal projects, yet I try to pick up something new every now and then.
	Here is the list of useful stuff I have created in past, some are still maintained while others more or less inactive.
